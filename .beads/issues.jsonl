Full-page canvas starts rendering\n2. Tiled canvas still visible with old transform\n3. Full-page canvas becomes visible\n4. Tiled canvas hidden\n\nIf step 2-3 spans more than 1 frame, the stale tiled canvas is visible at the wrong scale.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- DOM updates in mode transition code\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-page-element.ts`\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol D: Transform Desync** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1.

Log mode transitions:\n```typescript\nconsole.log('[MODE-FLAP]', {\n  zoom: camera.z,\n  currentMode: currentMode,\n  newMode: newMode,\n  threshold: 4.0,\n  hysteresis: 0.1,\n  effectiveEnter: 4.4,\n  effectiveExit: 3.6\n});\n```\n\n2. Test by slowly zooming through the 4.0x boundary\n3. Count mode transitions - should be exactly 1 per crossing\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Mode changes occur at hysteresis boundaries (3.6x and 4.4x), not at 4.0x\n- [ ] No rapid mode toggling at threshold\n- [ ] Single mode change per threshold crossing\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nMode transitions only occur when crossing the hysteresis boundaries, not at the raw 4.0x threshold.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster C (Threshold Behavior):** H9\n- Only relevant if logs show repeated mode toggles\n\n### Red Herring Check\n\nThis hypothesis is only relevant if debugging logs show multiple rapid mode transitions.

{"id":"amnesia-aqv","title":"PDF zoom-out blank page flash during mode transition","description":"## Root Cause Analysis (2026-01-24, Updated)\n\n### Phase 1: State Machine Unification ✅ COMPLETED\nUnified 4 overlapping state machines (ZoomOrchestrator, ZoomStateMachine, ZoomStateManager, ScaleStateManager) into single ZoomScaleService. Deleted deprecated files.\n\n**However, bug persists.** The race condition was only part of the problem.\n\n---\n\n## ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE (2026-01-24 Evening)\n\n### Bug 1: Blank Flash on Zoom-Out\n\n**Console Evidence:**\n```\n[ZOOM-CSS-RESET] page=9: CLEARING buffer due to aspect mismatch!\n  buffer=1792x1536 (aspect=1.167), target=441x666 (aspect=0.662), mismatch=76.2%\n[SNAPSHOT-SKIP] page=9: Skipping snapshot (insufficient coverage or aspect mismatch)\n```\n\n**Root Cause Chain:**\n1. At high zoom, tiled canvas buffer covers VIEWPORT only (landscape 1792x1536)\n2. Page aspect ratio is portrait (441x666)\n3. On zoom-out, `resetCssForZoomChange()` clears buffer due to 76% aspect mismatch\n4. Snapshot capture is skipped (nothing to snapshot)\n5. **Result: Blank page for 50-200ms until full-page render completes**\n\n**Attempted Fix (REVERTED):** Removed buffer clearing → showed extremely stretched/distorted content (worse UX)\n\n### Bug 2: Adjacent Tiles Missing During Pan at Max Zoom\n\n**Root Cause:**\n1. Prefetch lookahead uses velocity-based prediction (lagging indicator)\n2. At 32x zoom, small movements cover massive coordinate distances\n3. By the time velocity is calculated (~50-100ms), user has panned into blank zone\n4. RetryQueue only processes AFTER gesture ends, not during pan\n\n---\n\n## LLM COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS (2026-01-24)\n\n### For Bug 1: Pre-Cached Backdrop Approach\n**Verdict: CONDITIONALLY GO**\n\nImplementation requirements:\n1. **On entering tiled mode (zoom \u003e 4x):** Async render low-res full-page at scale ~2 (150 DPI)\n2. **Cache lifecycle:** Bind to tiled mode entry, evict on exit or memory pressure\n3. **On zoom-out transition:** Draw cached backdrop in PAGE COORDINATES (not canvas), use `object-fit: contain` semantics\n4. **Critical: NO clearRect** - Draw over existing content, never clear then draw\n5. **Memory hygiene:** Strict eviction policy\n\n**Alternative (Claude):** \"Preserve-Not-Replace\" - Freeze previous zoom layer instead of caching separate thumbnail. Draw new tiles OVER frozen layer.\n\n### For Bug 2: Layered Priority Prefetch System\n**Verdict: Use BOTH immediate directional + velocity lookahead**\n\nThree-layer priority system:\n1. **Layer 1 (High Priority):** Immediate \"bleed\" - on EVERY pointer move, fetch adjacent tiles in movement direction. Potentially synchronous.\n2. **Layer 2 (Medium Priority):** Velocity-based trajectory lookahead for fast flicks. CANCEL pending tasks on direction change.\n3. **Layer 3 (Fallback):** LOD proxy - immediately show scaled-up lower-res tiles while high-res loads\n\n**Critical Fix:** RetryQueue must be active DURING pan, not just after gesture ends.\n\n---\n\n## REMEDIATION PLAN\n\n### Phase 2: Pre-Cached Backdrop (Bug 1)\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- `pdf-infinite-canvas.ts`: Trigger backdrop render on tiled mode entry\n- `tile-cache-manager.ts`: Add backdrop cache with lifecycle management\n- `pdf-page-element.ts`: Draw backdrop in page coordinates on mode transition\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n1. Add `renderBackdropForPage(page, scale=2)` to TileCacheManager\n2. Call on mode transition: `full-page → tiled`\n3. On `tiled → full-page`: Check backdrop exists, draw at page bounds, skip clearRect\n4. Add backdrop eviction on mode exit or memory pressure\n\n### Phase 3: Layered Prefetch System (Bug 2)\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- `pdf-infinite-canvas.ts`: Add Layer 1 immediate prefetch on pointer move\n- `scroll-strategy.ts`: Add direction cancellation for Layer 2\n- `render-coordinator.ts`: Process retries DURING pan gesture\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n1. Hook pan delta (pointer move) to trigger immediate adjacent tile fetch\n2. Add velocity direction tracking with cancellation on reversal\n3. Enable RetryQueue processing during active gesture (controlled rate)\n4. Ensure fallback chain always returns something (even if placeholder)\n\n---\n\n## Validation Criteria\n\nAfter fix, should NOT see:\n- [ ] Blank flash on zoom-out (any zoom level transition)\n- [ ] `CLEARING buffer due to aspect mismatch` clearing visible content\n- [ ] Adjacent tiles blank when panning at max zoom\n- [ ] RetryQueue waiting until gesture end to process","notes":"## CLEANUP COMPLETE (2026-01-25)\n\nAll ineffective code from this session has been removed:\n\n### Phase 2A - REMOVED\n- Removed backdrop cache lookup in prepareForFullPageRender() (pdf-page-element.ts)\n- Removed ~80 lines of code that checked for cached full-page and drew it as backdrop\n- Method remains async (no harm) but the cache lookup logic is gone\n\n### Phase 2B - REMOVED  \n- Removed populateBackdropCache() method from pdf-infinite-canvas.ts (~45 lines)\n- Removed call site in executeModeTransition()\n\n### Phase 3 - ALREADY REVERTED (earlier in session)\n- scheduleDirectionalPrefetch() - removed\n- executeDirectionalPrefetch() - removed\n- processRetryQueueDuringGesture() - removed\n\n### Build Status\n- TypeScript: PASS\n- Build: PASS (9 warnings, all pre-existing)\n- Deployed to test vault\n\n### Current State\n- Codebase is back to pre-session state for this bug\n- Bug 1 (blank flash on zoom-out): NOT FIXED\n- Bug 2 (adjacent tiles missing during pan): NOT FIXED\n- Ready for research/architecture planning phase","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-24T01:51:05.58428-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-24T20:33:35.026247-06:00","comments":[{"id":10,"issue_id":"amnesia-aqv","author":"Josue Guevara","text":"Deferred: Overlay Canvas Lifecycle Optimization - The overlay canvas cleanup strategy depends on user engagement data from the Page Analytics Service (see: amnesia-3wf).

If these diverge without compensation, the visual result doesn't match the expected dimensions.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-infinite-canvas.ts` - Transform application\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-canvas-camera.ts` - Camera state management\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol D: Transform Desync** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1. Compare `getCameraTransform()` output with actual CSS:\n```typescript\nconsole.log('[TRANSFORM] camera:', camera, 'css:', container.style.transform);\n```\n\n2. Check if `applyTransform()` is called after every camera mutation\n3. Verify no intermediate state between camera update and transform apply\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single source of truth for scale value\n- [ ] CSS transform matches camera state exactly\n- [ ] Every camera mutation followed by `applyTransform()`\n- [ ] No async gaps between camera change and DOM update\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nEither CSS transform compensates for scale tier quantization, or canvas dimensions account for the transform scale, ensuring visual coherence.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster C (Threshold Behavior):** Related to scale calculation discrepancies","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T18:22:44.89272-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-20T22:55:47.813354-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T22:55:47.813354-06:00","close_reason":"Investigation complete. INV-3 is maintained correctly - every camera mutation is followed by applyTransform() and the CSS transform matches camera state. Initial detection showed apparent violations, but these were false positives caused by browser CSS value normalization (browsers round float values to 5-6 decimal places when reading back transform strings). Fixed the INV-3 coherence check in pdf-infinite-canvas.ts to use numerical comparison with 0.01px tolerance instead of string comparison. The 'scale divergence' between camera.z (continuous) and scaleTier (discrete) is intentional and correct - CSS uses continuous zoom for visual smoothness while canvas uses discrete tiers for quality.

Stop zooming - observe corruption\n4.

When getBestAvailable() was calculating fallback tile positions, it used default 256px instead of actual 512px, causing incorrect tile lookups.","created_at":"2026-01-24T03:33:55Z"},{"id":4,"issue_id":"amnesia-e4i","author":"Josue Guevara","text":"PROGRESS UPDATE (2026-01-24):\n\nFIXES IMPLEMENTED:\n1.

If the conversion to CSS pixels differs between:\n- Tiled path: `pageHeight * scaleTier / 72 * dpi`\n- Full-page path: `pageHeight * zoom / 72 * dpi`\n\n...the resulting dimensions may not match, especially if intermediate calculations use different rounding.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-canvas-camera.ts` - Coordinate conversions\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/mupdf-worker.ts` - PDF rendering with unit conversion\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/tile-render-engine.ts` - Tile coordinate calculations\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol E: Coordinate Conversion Error** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1.

Compare conversion results between paths at same zoom level\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single PDF units conversion function used throughout\n- [ ] Same page renders to identical dimensions regardless of path\n- [ ] Conversion is deterministic and reversible\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nPDF units to CSS pixels conversion is centralized and consistent across all rendering paths.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster A (Unit/Rounding - PRIMARY):** H1, H4, H5, H6, H7\n- All reduce to INV-4 violations producing int vs float disagreement","notes":"## Analysis Update (2026-01-22)\n\n**Finding:** This issue is ORTHOGONAL to ScaleStateManager architecture.\n\nScaleStateManager ensures scale consistency across TIME (epoch-based validation).

Retina-Quality Buffer at Max Zoom\n- Ensure buffer sizing accounts for device pixel ratio at all zoom levels\n- At \u003e16x zoom (full-page mode), buffer should still provide retina-quality pixels for visible region\n- Scale calculation: visible viewport × devicePixelRatio = minimum buffer resolution\n\n### 2. Focal-Point Radial Priority System\n- Tiles/pages near focal point: highest quality, highest cache priority\n- Middle-distance tiles: standard quality\n- Distant tiles/pages: thumbnails or lower quality acceptable\n- Priority radiates outward from focal point (zoom center or pan direction)\n\n### 3. Pan-Gesture Quality Preservation\n- During pan at high zoom: maintain quality for current view, don't downgrade\n- Pre-fetch adjacent tiles at current quality level\n- Only drop quality for tiles scrolling OUT of view, not IN\n\n### 4. Zoom Direction Awareness\n- Zoom in: Evict distant pages, prioritize focal point tiles at high quality\n- Zoom out: Transition to cached buffer, then generate thumbnails for newly visible pages\n- Keep last full-size pages cached until re-zoom gesture initiates\n\n### 5. Memory Management\n- Prevent Chromium tile_manager memory exhaustion at 32x zoom\n- Graceful quality degradation based on distance from focal point\n\n## Key Behaviors\n\n- Cache preserves last full-size pages until re-zoom gesture initiates\n- Focal-point radial priority ensures best quality where user is looking\n- Pan gestures maintain quality (no flicker/blur during simple panning)\n- Zoom-out shows previously cached high-quality buffer before thumbnails\n\n## Related Files\n\n- tile-cache-manager.ts\n- tile-render-engine.ts\n- render-coordinator.ts\n- progressive-tile-renderer.ts\n- pdf-infinite-canvas.ts (getTilePriority)","notes":"Phase 1 COMPLETE (2026-01-22): Focal-point-aware eviction fully implemented.\n\nImplemented:\n- TileCacheManager.setPriorityFunction() API\n- TileCacheManager.evictByPriority() implementation  \n- Memory pressure integration (3 levels)\n- Priority function wired in pdf-infinite-canvas using actual PageLayout positions\n- Cleanup: priority function cleared on canvas destroy\n- Fixed coordinate bug for multi-page priority\n\nRemaining Phases:\n- Phase 2: Retina-Quality Buffer (0%)\n- Phase 3: Pan-Gesture Quality Preservation (0%)\n- Phase 4: Zoom Direction Awareness (0%)\n- Phase 7-9: Quality falloff (0%)\n\nPhase 1 should provide enough memory relief to attempt H1 verification (amnesia-5hf).

'tiled' : 'full-page';\n    // Pre-render in background\n    this.preRenderForMode(this.pendingMode, newZoom);\n  } else {\n    // Gesture ended, execute transition\n    if (this.pendingMode !== this.currentMode) {\n      this.executeTransition(this.pendingMode);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `pdf-infinite-canvas.ts` (mode transition logic in `zoomAtPoint()`)\n- `pdf-page-element.ts` (`prepareForTiledRender()`, `prepareForFullPageRender()`)","acceptance_criteria":"## Success Criteria (ALL must pass)\n\n### Visual Tests (Manual)\n- [ ] **No Blank Frames:** Crossing 4x threshold shows NO blank period\n- [ ] **Smooth Transition:** Mode switch has fade/crossfade effect\n- [ ] **Hysteresis Works:** Oscillating around 4x doesn't cause rapid mode flipping\n\n### State Machine Tests\n- [ ] **Gesture Detection:** Mode switch only happens when `isGestureActive === false`\n- [ ] **Pending Mode Tracked:** `this.pendingMode` correctly set during gesture\n- [ ] **Pre-render Triggered:** Console shows background render started during gesture\n\n### Test Scenarios\n- [ ] **Zoom Through Threshold:** Pinch from 2x → 8x; no visual discontinuity at 4x\n- [ ] **Threshold Oscillation:** Hover zoom around 3.8-4.2x for 5 seconds; no flicker\n- [ ] **Quick Reverse:** Zoom to 6x, immediately back to 2x; transitions are smooth\n\n### Validation Commands\n```javascript\n// Track mode transitions\nlet transitionCount = 0;\nconst originalPrepare = element.prepareForTiledRender;\nelement.prepareForTiledRender = function() {\n  transitionCount++;\n  console.log(`Mode transition #${transitionCount}`);\n  return originalPrepare.call(this);\n};\n\n// Zoom through threshold multiple times\n// Count should be LOW (1-2 per direction, not dozens)\n```\n\n### Regression Checks\n- [ ] Tile rendering still activates eventually at high zoom\n- [ ] Full-page rendering still works at low zoom\n- [ ] No memory leaks from pending pre-renders","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-20T00:16:36.002394-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-20T03:30:07.978163-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T03:30:07.978163-06:00","close_reason":"Implemented deferred mode transitions: pendingModeTransition tracks target mode during gesture, executeModeTransition() executes on gesture end.
