Selection mode feedback (text vs region)\n2. Confidence-based visual styling\n3. Hover states and interaction consistency\n4. Orphaned highlight indicators\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n**Annotation Layer** (`pdf-page-element.ts:2954-3005`):\n```typescript\nsetHighlights(highlights: PageHighlight[]): void {\n  this.annotationLayerEl.innerHTML = '';\n  for (const highlight of highlights) {\n    for (const rect of highlight.rects) {\n      const el = document.createElement('div');\n      el.className = 'pdf-highlight';\n      el.dataset.annotationId = highlight.annotationId;\n      el.style.cssText = `...`;\n      el.addEventListener('click', ...);\n      this.annotationLayerEl.appendChild(el);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**SVG Annotation Layer** (`pdf-annotation-layer.ts`):\n- Alternative SVG-based rendering\n- Blend mode filter for better appearance\n\n## Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Visual Feedback\n\n1. Add selection mode indicator (text cursor vs crosshair)\n2. Add highlight confidence styling (solid vs dashed border)\n3. Add orphaned highlight indicator (warning icon)\n4. Improve hover states\n\n### Phase 2: Interaction Polish\n\n1. Add highlight preview during selection\n2. Add drag-to-adjust highlight bounds\n3. Add multi-select for batch operations\n4. Keyboard navigation between highlights\n\n### Phase 3: Performance\n\n1. Use canvas-based rendering for high highlight counts\n2. Virtualize highlights outside viewport\n3. Debounce re-renders during scroll\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Add selection mode visual indicator\n- [ ] Implement confidence-based styling (solid/dashed)\n- [ ] Add orphaned highlight warning icon\n- [ ] Improve hover states (color preview, actions)\n- [ ] Add highlight preview during selection\n- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation\n- [ ] Add virtualization for many highlights\n- [ ] Create highlight interaction tests\n\n## Styling Proposal\n\n```css\n/* High confidence - solid */\n.pdf-highlight[data-confidence=\"high\"] {\n  border: none;\n  background: rgba(255, 235, 59, 0.4);\n}\n\n/* Medium confidence - subtle dashed */\n.pdf-highlight[data-confidence=\"medium\"] {\n  border: 1px dashed rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n  background: rgba(255, 235, 59, 0.3);\n}\n\n/* Low confidence (visual match only) */\n.pdf-highlight[data-confidence=\"low\"] {\n  border: 2px dashed rgba(255, 152, 0, 0.5);\n  background: rgba(255, 235, 59, 0.2);\n}\n\n/* Orphaned - could not re-anchor */\n.pdf-highlight[data-orphaned=\"true\"] {\n  border: 2px dashed rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.5);\n  background: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.1);\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-page-element.ts` - Enhanced rendering\n- `src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-annotation-layer.ts` - SVG styling\n- `src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-selection-handler.ts` - Mode indicator\n- `styles.css` - Add highlight confidence styles\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Selection mode visually indicated\n- [ ] Confidence reflected in highlight appearance\n- [ ] Orphaned highlights clearly marked\n- [ ] Smooth hover interactions\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- PDF Highlights Core","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T02:13:21.155075-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-26T02:13:21.155075-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"amnesia-002","depends_on_id":"amnesia-7bz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-26T02:16:39.508395-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara"}]}

Full-page canvas starts rendering\n2. Tiled canvas still visible with old transform\n3. Full-page canvas becomes visible\n4. Tiled canvas hidden\n\nIf step 2-3 spans more than 1 frame, the stale tiled canvas is visible at the wrong scale.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- DOM updates in mode transition code\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-page-element.ts`\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol D: Transform Desync** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1.

Check if tiled canvas is hidden before transform updates\n3. Verify atomic visibility swap\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Tiled canvas hidden before full-page visible (atomic swap)\n- [ ] No frame where both canvases are visible with different transforms\n- [ ] Transform updates are synchronous with visibility changes\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nVisibility swap is atomic - tiled canvas is hidden in the same frame that full-page canvas becomes visible, with no intermediate state.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster B (Two-Track Ordering):** H3, H8, H10\n- Explains \"brief\" artifacts via swap timing or stale style\n\n### Red Herring Check\n\nThis hypothesis is only relevant if the artifact is exactly 1-2 frames long.

Open PDF in Amnesia\r\n2. Zoom to 32x on any page\r\n3. Pan rapidly to trigger epoch drift\r\n4. **Without circuit breaker:** Page stays blank indefinitely\r\n5. **With circuit breaker:** After ~5 seconds, fallback renders content\r\n6. Stop panning, wait 2 seconds\r\n7.

If:\n- Tiled canvas: `518 * 2 = 1036 physical pixels`\n- CSS container: `517.647 CSS pixels`\n\nThe mismatch could be due to DPR being applied to one but not the other, or being applied at different precision levels.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- Canvas sizing code throughout `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/`\n- Search for `devicePixelRatio` or `dpr` usage\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol E: Coordinate Conversion Error** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1. Audit DPR usage:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"devicePixelRatio\\|dpr\" apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/\n```\n\n2.

{"id":"amnesia-53i","title":"Rabbit Hole Links - Recursive Link Preview System","description":"## Overview\n\nA recursive link preview feature inspired by Curvenote/MyST and Wikipedia Navigation Popups that enables hover-based content previews within PDF and EPUB documents. Hovering over a link shows a preview tooltip, and links within that preview can spawn additional nested previews - enabling deep content exploration without navigating away.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Recursive Preview Popups\n- Hover over any link to see a preview popup\n- Links inside previews can spawn additional nested popups (unlimited depth)\n- Cascade offset positioning to show nesting hierarchy\n- Click-away to close, or navigate into the content\n\n### 2. Link Creation from Selection\n- Add \"Link\" button to existing HighlightPopup\n- Two link types:\n  - **Wikilink**: Uses Obsidian's native FuzzySuggestModal for consistent UX\n  - **Hyperlink**: Custom modal for external URLs (URL field only)\n- Links stored alongside highlights/annotations (investigate storage consolidation)\n\n### 3. Link Type Support\n- **Internal document links**: Footnotes, TOC refs, cross-references (existing in PDFs/EPUBs)\n- **Wikilinks to Obsidian notes**: [[Note]] style with Obsidian's page preview behavior\n- **External URLs**: Show URL + metadata from page (title, description)\n\n### 4. PDF Link Enhancement\n- Detect and enhance existing PDF link annotations via MuPDF\n- Visual layer showing clickable regions\n- Same hover preview behavior as user-created links\n\n## Technical Feasibility\n\n### Already Available\n- MuPDF WASM has full `getLinks()` API for PDF link extraction\n- `HighlightPopup.svelte` provides popup infrastructure\n- `Portal.svelte` for DOM escape\n- Selection handling for both PDF and EPUB\n- Link click handling in EPUB (shadow-dom-renderer.ts:840-907)\n\n### Needs Implementation\n- Recursive popup manager (stack/tree management)\n- Link creation UI and storage\n- PDF link layer (similar to annotation layer)\n- Obsidian API integration (page preview, link suggester)\n- URL metadata fetching service\n\n## Reference Implementations\n- **MyST Markdown**: Hover references with live preview\n- **Wikipedia Navigation Popups**: Recursive popups on hover\n- **Obsidian Page Preview**: Native note preview on hover\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Hover over any supported link shows preview within 200ms\n- [ ] Nested previews cascade with clear visual hierarchy\n- [ ] User can create wikilinks using Obsidian suggester\n- [ ] User can create hyperlinks via simple URL modal\n- [ ] PDF native links detected and enhanced\n- [ ] EPUB internal links show content preview\n- [ ] Settings for enabling/disabling feature\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T23:00:09.655874-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-25T23:00:09.655874-06:00"}

{"id":"amnesia-7bz","title":"PDF Highlights Core - Text Selection to Highlight Pipeline","description":"# PDF Highlights Core\n\n## Problem\n\nPDF highlighting infrastructure exists but the end-to-end pipeline is unreliable:\n1. Text selection depends on text layer quality (see amnesia-q5c)\n2. Selection-to-highlight flow is disconnected from content-type awareness\n3. No graceful degradation for scanned/vector PDFs\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n**Selection Handler** (`pdf-selection-handler.ts`):\n- Captures text selection via `window.getSelection()`\n- Normalizes rects to 0-1 coordinates\n- Extracts context (prefix/suffix)\n- Calls `PdfHighlightService.createHighlight()`\n\n**PDF Highlight Service** (`pdf-highlight-service.ts`):\n- Creates `PdfHighlightSelector` with page, rects, text quote\n- Delegates to base `HighlightService`\n\n**Rendering** (`pdf-page-element.ts:2954-3005`):\n- SVG rectangles positioned over canvas\n- Click handling for selection\n\n## Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Content-Type Aware Selection\n\n1. Query content type before enabling selection\n2. For TEXT_HEAVY: Use current text layer selection\n3. For SCANNED/VECTOR: Show region selection mode with OCR option\n4.

Rendered as DOM.\n- **Fixed-Layout**: Pages have fixed dimensions. Rendered as pixmaps (like PDF).\n\nThe `epub-format-detector.ts` exists but `detectFixedLayout()` in `mupdf-epub-bridge.ts` currently returns `false` (TODO).\n\n## Related Files\n\n### Detection\n| File | Purpose | Key Lines |\n|------|---------|-----------|\n| `src/reader/renderer/epub/epub-format-detector.ts` | Format detection logic | 66-82 (OPF metadata), 94-141 (HTML heuristics) |\n| `src/reader/renderer/epub/mupdf-epub-bridge.ts` | Bridge API | 662-667 (`detectFixedLayout()` - returns false TODO) |\n\n### Renderers\n| File | Purpose | Key Lines |\n|------|---------|-----------|\n| `src/reader/shadow-dom-renderer.ts` | Main EPUB renderer (reflowable) | 1-1520+ |\n| `src/reader/renderer/epub/fixed-layout-epub-renderer.ts` | Pixmap renderer (fixed-layout) | 92-432 (tile rendering, zoom/pan) |\n\n### PDF Reference (for fixed-layout optimization)\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `tile-cache-manager.ts` | 3-tier tile caching |\n| `content-type-classifier.ts` | Page content classification |\n| `progressive-tile-renderer.ts` | Scale tier management |\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Wire Up Format Detection\n\n1. Implement `detectFixedLayout()` in `mupdf-epub-bridge.ts`:\n```typescript\nasync detectFixedLayout(): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e {\n  // Check OPF rendition:layout property\n  const metadata = await this.getMetadata();\n  if (metadata.renditionLayout === 'pre-paginated') return true;\n  \n  // Check first chapter for fixed-layout heuristics\n  const firstChapter = await this.getChapterHtml(0);\n  return EpubFormatDetector.isFixedLayout(firstChapter);\n}\n```\n\n2. Update `EpubFormatDetector` to expose detection methods publicly\n\n### Phase 2: Apply Format-Specific Optimizations\n\n**For Reflowable EPUBs:**\n- Keep current Shadow DOM rendering\n- Add chapter content complexity classification:\n  - `text-heavy`: Cache priority LOW (reflow is cheap)\n  - `image-heavy`: Cache priority HIGH (images are expensive)\n  - `mixed`: Cache priority MEDIUM\n\n**For Fixed-Layout EPUBs:**\n- Route to `FixedLayoutEpubRenderer`\n- Enable PDF-style tile caching\n- Apply scale quantization for cache efficiency\n- Use progressive loading (low-res → high-res)\n\n### Phase 3: Content Complexity Classification\n\nCreate `epub-content-classifier.ts`:\n```typescript\ninterface ChapterClassification {\n  type: 'text-heavy' | 'image-heavy' | 'mixed';\n  imageCount: number;\n  wordCount: number;\n  estimatedRenderCost: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';\n}\n\nfunction classifyChapter(html: string): ChapterClassification {\n  const imgCount = (html.match(/\u003cimg/g) || []).length;\n  const textLength = html.replace(/\u003c[^\u003e]*\u003e/g, '').length;\n  // Classification logic...\n}\n```\n\n## Detection Heuristics (from epub-format-detector.ts)\n\n| Signal | Fixed-Layout Indicator |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| OPF `rendition:layout=\"pre-paginated\"` | Strong |\n| HTML viewport meta tag | Strong |\n| SVG viewBox attribute | Strong |\n| CSS fixed dimensions (vw/vh units) | Medium |\n| Image-only content | Medium |\n| No text content | Weak |\n\n## Validation\n\n| Check | Expected | How to Verify |\n|-------|----------|---------------|\n| Reflowable detected | Returns false | Test with standard EPUB |\n| Fixed-layout detected | Returns true | Test with comic EPUB |\n| Fixed-layout routes to renderer | Uses FixedLayoutEpubRenderer | View inspection |\n| Tile caching for fixed-layout | Cache stats \u003e 0 | Cache metrics |\n| Chapter classification | Types assigned | Debug log |\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `detectFixedLayout()` correctly identifies format\n- [ ] Fixed-layout EPUBs use `FixedLayoutEpubRenderer`\n- [ ] Fixed-layout EPUBs benefit from tile caching\n- [ ] Chapter complexity is classified for reflowable EPUBs\n- [ ] Cache priority uses complexity classification\n- [ ] No regression for standard reflowable EPUBs\n\n## Test Cases\n\n| EPUB Type | Expected Behavior |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| Novel (text-only) | Reflowable, text-heavy classification |\n| Textbook (mixed content) | Reflowable, mixed classification |\n| Comic/Manga | Fixed-layout, tile caching enabled |\n| Children's picture book | Fixed-layout, tile caching enabled |\n\n## PDF Reference: Content-Type Classifier\n\nThe PDF `content-type-classifier.ts` classifies pages as:\n- `SCANNED_JPEG`: Direct JPEG extraction\n- `SCANNED_OTHER`: Bitmap rendering\n- `VECTOR_HEAVY`: Scale reduction optimization\n- `TEXT_HEAVY`: Standard rendering\n- `MIXED`: Balanced approach\n- `COMPLEX`: Conservative rendering\n\nSimilar classification for EPUB chapters could inform cache priority and prefetch decisions.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:17:39.791513-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-26T01:17:39.791513-06:00"}

During tiled→full-page transition, create an overlay canvas (invisible, opacity=0)\n2. Render new full-page content to the overlay while main canvas remains visible\n3. When overlay render completes, make overlay visible (opacity=1) \n4. Copy overlay content to main canvas for cleanup\n5.

Get inserted into spatial index, causing memory accumulation\n4. Create confusion in logs and potential visual issues\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\n**1. Stale Scale Validation in requestRender (render-coordinator.ts:1615-1646)**\n- Before processing any tile request, validate that request.tile.scale matches current expected scale\n- If scale mismatch is \u003e4x, drop the request immediately\n- This prevents stale tiles from using resources and polluting the spatial index\n\n**2. Aggressive Queue Cleanup on Zoom Change (render-coordinator.ts:755-770)**\n- When zoom changes by \u003e4x, call abortStaleScaleTiles() to clear the queue\n- This complements the per-request validation with bulk cleanup\n- Prevents queue from being clogged with stale-scale requests\n\n### Technical Details\n- Expected scale is calculated from current zoom via getTileScale(zoom, devicePixelRatio)\n- Tolerance is 4x to allow for normal scale variation during transitions\n- Stale requests return {success: false, error: 'Stale scale'} to prevent retry\n\n### Expected Behavior After Fix\n- No more 'Using full-page fallback for tile at scale 32' logs when zoom is low\n- SpatialTileIndex tile count should stabilize (not grow infinitely)\n- Memory usage during zoom gestures should be more predictable","created_at":"2026-01-27T05:51:43Z"},{"id":34,"issue_id":"amnesia-aqv","author":"Josue Guevara","text":"## Fix: Adaptive Fallback Scale (2026-01-27)\n\n### Root Cause\nAt zoom 32x, fallback tiles used fixed scale 4, causing 8× stretching = extremely blurry.\nOnly 27% of viewport had high-res tiles (86/317 needed), rest was blurry fallback.\n\n### Fix Applied\nModified `pdf-infinite-canvas.ts` to use adaptive fallback scale based on target zoom:\n- Calculate: `adaptiveFallbackScale = min(16, max(4, ceil(targetScale / 4)))`\n- At zoom 32x (target scale 64): now uses scale 8 fallback (4× stretch instead of 8×)\n- Also checks for higher-scale cached full-pages (scale 16, 8) before lower ones\n\n### Test Results\n- Fallback: was `actual=4`, now `actual=8` (2× better quality)\n- Spatial index: found 130 tiles, composited 100/100\n- Critical batch: 2848ms (improved from 6288ms)\n\n### Remaining Issues\n- Snapshot drift warnings still present (coordinate drift during async render)\n- Tile render throughput still limiting factor at extreme zoom","created_at":"2026-01-27T07:35:34Z"},{"id":35,"issue_id":"amnesia-aqv","author":"Josue Guevara","text":"## Bug Persists: High-Res Tiles Not Loading at 32x Zoom (2026-01-27)\n\n### Symptom\nUser zooms to 32x, waits several seconds, but content remains blurry. High-res tiles appear to render but don't display correctly.\n\n### Investigation Findings\n\n#### 1. Tile Coverage Gap\nAt 32x zoom with 128px tiles:\n- Viewport needs ~317 tiles (59×86 PDF units ÷ 4×4 tile size per tile)\n- Spatial index only returns ~86 tiles (27% coverage)\n- Remaining 73% uses fallback tiles stretched from scale 4→32 (8× stretch)\n\n#### 2. Render Throughput Bottleneck\n- Critical batch: 54 tiles in 6.3 seconds (116ms/tile average)\n- Semaphore permits: 4-8 concurrent (base 4 × policy multiplier)\n- Workers are saturated; tiles wait 1-6 seconds for render permit\n- `[Perf] medium tile waited 5656.6ms for render permit (queue: 9)`\n\n#### 3. Spatial Index Appears to Work\nLogs show successful flow:\n```\n[SpatialTileIndex] INSERT page=10 tileCount=120\n[compositeCachedTiles] page=10 scale=32 queryRegion=(222,421 59x86) results=86\n[addTilesToExistingCanvas] page=10: SUCCESS drew 86/86 tiles\n```\nBut visual remains blurry despite '86 tiles drawn successfully'.\n\n#### 4. Snapshot Drift Detected\n```\n[TILE-CORRUPTION-DIAG] Snapshot drift detected:\n{hasDrift: true, sizeDrift: {...}, offsetDrift: {...}, epochDrift: 0,\nrecommendation: 'Use snapshot values for coordinate calculations or re-request tiles'}\n```\nCanvas position/size has changed since tiles were requested. Tiles may be drawn at wrong positions.\n\n#### 5. Scale Mismatch Hypothesis\nThe logs show tiles at 'scale 32' being composited, but the BITMAP CONTENT may be low-res:\n- When `extractTileFromFullPageCache` creates fallback, it crops from scale-4 full-page\n- The resulting bitmap is 128×128 but contains 16×16 upscaled content\n- This bitmap is inserted into spatial index claiming scale=32\n- Query returns it as 'scale 32' but content is actually scale 4\n\n### Attempted Fixes (This Session)\n\n#### Fix 1: Adaptive Fallback Scale (Committed: 0d57352)\nChanged `FALLBACK_SCALE` from fixed 4 to adaptive:\n```javascript\nconst adaptiveFallbackScale = Math.min(16, Math.max(4, Math.ceil(targetScale / 4)));\n```\n- At zoom 32x: now uses scale 8 fallback (4× stretch instead of 8×)\n- Result: Fallback quality improved but core issue persists\n\n#### Fix 2: Two-Track Pipeline CSS Preset (Earlier)\n- Pre-set canvas CSS in Interaction Track before tiles arrive\n- `presetViewportOnlyCss()` called before tile requests\n- Result: CSS no longer set in Refinement Track, but visual still blurry\n\n### Root Cause Hypotheses (Unverified)\n\n1. **Bitmap Content Mismatch**: Spatial index tiles claim scale=32 but bitmap content is actually scale 4 from full-page extraction. The `cssStretch` filter (\u003e2.0) should catch this but may not be working.\n\n2. **Tile Position Drift**: Snapshot drift causes tiles to be drawn at wrong canvas coordinates. High-res tiles ARE being rendered but placed off-screen or overwritten.\n\n3. **Render Order Race**: High-res tiles composite successfully, then fallback render OVERWRITES them. The `FALLBACK-IMMEDIATE: SKIPPED` logic may not be catching all cases.\n\n4. **Epoch Validation Too Strict/Loose**: `addTilesToExistingCanvas` has EPOCH_TOLERANCE=3. If epoch drifts during 6+ second render, tiles may be rejected or drawn with wrong coordinates.\n\n### Diagnostic Data Needed\n\n1. Verify bitmap dimensions in `addTilesToExistingCanvas` - are they 128×128 with scale-32 content or scale-4 content?\n2. Log canvas coordinates where tiles are drawn vs viewport bounds\n3. Check if any render happens AFTER `addTilesToExistingCanvas` that overwrites content\n4. Verify `lastRenderState.tileScale` is being set correctly after compositing\n\n### Files Involved\n- `pdf-infinite-canvas.ts`: Streaming render, fallback logic, compositeCachedTilesForPage\n- `pdf-page-element.ts`: renderTiles, addTilesToExistingCanvas, lastRenderState\n- `tile-cache-manager.ts`: extractTileFromFullPageCache, getBestAvailableBitmap\n- `spatial-tile-index.ts`: insert, getBestAvailable, getRegionKey\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Add diagnostic logging to verify actual bitmap scale vs claimed scale\n2. Trace complete tile lifecycle from render → cache → spatial index → composite\n3. Verify no render overwrites high-res content after compositing\n4.

At 32x, tiles are requested but viewport positioning fails.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Session Findings\r\n\r\n#### Fix 1: Cross-Realm instanceof Blob (RESOLVED)\r\n**Problem:** At 32x zoom, tiles were cached with `dims=0x0`, causing compositing to silently succeed with \"drew 0/25 tiles\".\r\n\r\n**Root Cause:** The `instanceof Blob` check at `render-coordinator.ts:2381` is unreliable in Electron's cross-realm environment. When the callback returns a `TileRenderResult` object containing a Blob, `instanceof` may incorrectly match.\r\n\r\n**Fix Applied:** Replaced with duck-typing:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Before (broken in Electron)\r\nif (result instanceof Blob) { ... }\r\n\r\n// After (cross-realm safe)\r\nconst isTileRenderResult = result \u0026\u0026 typeof result === 'object' \u0026\u0026 'format' in result;\r\nif (isTileRenderResult) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Verification:** Logs now show `dims=128x128` instead of `dims=0x0`.\r\n\r\n#### Fix 2: Viewport Offset Regression (RESOLVED)\r\n**Problem:** After the dims fix, pages were \"escaping their containers\" at normal zoom levels.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause:** Always setting viewport offset even at low zoom caused canvas misalignment.\r\n\r\n**Fix Applied:** Conditional viewport offset based on zoom level:\r\n- High zoom (\u003e=8x): Use viewport offset for tile positioning\r\n- Low zoom (\u003c8x): Use offset (0,0) to prevent misalignment\r\n\r\n#### Fix 3: 32x Zoom Still Blank (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)\r\n**Observation:** 16x renders perfectly with sharp text. 32x shows blank/white areas.\r\n\r\n**Hypothesis:** At 32x, the viewport offset calculation places the visible area in margin/white space rather than document content. The issue is not tile rendering, but WHERE those tiles are positioned relative to the viewport.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Architecture Gap Analysis (per balancing-forces.md)\r\n\r\n#### INV-7: Tile Data Integrity\r\n- **Breach FIXED:** dims=0x0 tiles were being cached (violating \"tile.width \u003e 0 ∧ tile.height \u003e 0\")\r\n- **Remaining Gap:** Defense-in-depth validation not yet implemented at cache insertion point\r\n\r\n#### INV-5: Mode Transition Continuity\r\n- **Potential Breach:** When transitioning from 16x (works) to 32x (fails), there's no fallback tile display\r\n- **Missing:** CSS-scale fallback using parent tile lookup (Phase 1C in remediation plan)\r\n\r\n#### INV-6: Scale/Layout Atomicity\r\n- **Unknown:** Need to verify tiles in same batch use same scale\r\n- **Test:** Add multi-scale detection logging to verify no `[MULTI-SCALE-BUG]` errors at 32x\r\n\r\n#### Performance Budget Gaps\r\n- **Memory Budget (16x-32x):** Spec allows 400 tiles, 250MB. Actual maxTilesPerPage=50 caps at 37% coverage.\r\n- **First Tile Visible:** Spec is \u003c50ms. At 32x, tiles arrive but position incorrectly (visual = blank).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Debugging Recommendations for Future Sessions\r\n\r\n#### Protocol G (INV-7) - Start Here\r\n1. Enable `[CALLBACK-DEBUG]` logging in render-coordinator.ts\r\n2. Verify HybridDocumentProvider returns TileRenderResult with dimensions\r\n3. Add cache insertion rejection for dims=0x0 tiles\r\n\r\n#### Protocol F (INV-6) - Multi-Scale Detection\r\n1. Add scale debug logging at 32x zoom\r\n2. Check `uniqueScales` array - should have single value\r\n3. Verify epoch consistency across tile batch\r\n\r\n#### Protocol A (INV-1) - Focal Point\r\n1. At 32x, verify focal point calculation\r\n2. Check if viewport offset overshoots document bounds\r\n3. Log `viewportPdfX, viewportPdfY` to see if they're in margin space\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Tools and Skills to Use\r\n\r\n#### MCP DevTools (Essential)\r\n- `mcp__obsidian-devtools__obsidian_connect()` - Connect to Obsidian\r\n- `mcp__obsidian-devtools__obsidian_reload_plugin({ pluginId: 'amnesia' })` - Hot reload\r\n- `mcp__obsidian-devtools__obsidian_get_console_logs({ level: 'error', limit: 50 })` - Capture errors\r\n- `mcp__obsidian-devtools__obsidian_execute_js()` - Introspect live state\r\n\r\n#### Skills to Invoke\r\n1. `superpowers:systematic-debugging` - ALWAYS use before proposing fixes\r\n2. `superpowers:verification-before-completion` - Never claim \"fixed\" without evidence\r\n3. `feature-dev:code-explorer` - Trace tile flow through pipeline\r\n\r\n#### Console Commands (in Obsidian)\r\n```javascript\r\n// Check tile cache for dims=0x0\r\nconst cache = window.amnesiaTileCache;\r\nfor (const [key, entry] of cache.cache) {\r\n  if (entry.width === 0 || entry.height === 0) {\r\n    console.error('[INV-7-VIOLATION]', key, entry);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Inspect page element render state\r\nconst view = app.workspace.getLeavesOfType('amnesia-reader')[0].view;\r\nconst pages = view.component.$$.ctx[3].pageManager.visiblePages;\r\npages.forEach(p =\u003e console.log(p.element.lastRenderState));\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Crucial Patterns to Test\r\n\r\n1. **Zoom Progression:** 1x → 4x → 8x → 16x → 32x → 16x → 8x → 4x → 1x\r\n   - Each transition should be visually seamless\r\n   - No blank flashes or content jumps\r\n\r\n2. **Page Transitions at 32x:** Scroll to new page while at 32x\r\n   - New page should render tiles (not stay blank)\r\n   - Previous page tiles should be evicted gracefully\r\n\r\n3. **Gesture Interruption:** Start zooming to 32x, quickly pan, then release\r\n   - Tiles should settle on correct content (not margin)\r\n   - Recovery should be \u003c500ms (per quality floor)\r\n\r\n4. **Multi-Page Stress:** Zoom to 32x, scroll rapidly through 10 pages\r\n   - No accumulating blank pages\r\n   - Memory should stay under 250MB budget\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Untested Areas / Coverage Gaps\r\n\r\n1. **establishMinimalRenderState Timing:** Called conditionally based on zoom, but timing of scale/offset changes may race with tile arrival\r\n\r\n2. **Viewport Offset Clamping:** At 32x, viewport offset may exceed document bounds - no clamping logic exists\r\n\r\n3. **Tile Grid vs Canvas Buffer:** At high zoom, canvas buffer size (4096x4096 limit?) may be exceeded, silently failing\r\n\r\n4. **Prefetch During Render:** Spec says prefetch blocked during active rendering - may cause tile starvation at 32x\r\n\r\n5. **LRU Eviction at 32x:** With 135 tiles needed but maxTilesPerPage=50, LRU eviction may remove tiles immediately after rendering\r\n\r\n6. **Scale Tier Discontinuity:** Jump from tileScale=16 to tileScale=32 may cause tile coverage mismatch\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Web Research: Electron Cross-Realm instanceof\r\n\r\n**Confirmed Pattern:** Electron's multi-context architecture (main, renderer, preload) means objects from different contexts have different prototypes. `instanceof` checks fail across realm boundaries.\r\n\r\n**Industry Solution:** Use duck-typing (`'property' in obj`) or `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` instead of `instanceof`.\r\n\r\n**Reference:** This is a known Electron/Node.js limitation documented in multiple sources including Electron's own documentation on context isolation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Next Session Recommendations\r\n\r\n1. **Start with Protocol G** - Verify the dims fix is working at ALL scale levels\r\n2. **Add viewport offset clamping** - Prevent offset from placing viewport outside document bounds\r\n3. **Test maxTilesPerPage=150** - Per Phase 1B in remediation plan\r\n4. **Implement CSS-scale fallback** - Show stretched lower-res tiles while high-res loads (Phase 1C)\r\n5. **Profile memory at 32x** - Ensure we're not hitting canvas size limits\r\n","created_at":"2026-01-28T05:38:32Z"},{"id":41,"issue_id":"amnesia-aqv","author":"Josue Guevara","text":"## Code Review Agent Analysis (2026-01-27)\r\n\r\nTwo parallel code review agents analyzed the PDF tile rendering system.

Canvas CSS dimensions do not match page container dimensions\n\n**NOT a camera math issue** - Position tracking diagnostics confirm expected vs actual page positions match within tolerance.

Canvas buffer resizing during viewport changes\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open PDF with \"Amnesia: Open book\" command\n2. Zoom in to 16x-32x using pinch gesture\n3. Stop zooming - observe corruption\n4. Pan around - corruption may appear/disappear/change\n\n## NOT the Issue\n\n- Camera focal point math (verified correct)\n- Page element positioning (verified correct)  \n- CSS transform coherence (small rounding errors only)\n- Mode transitions (snapshots working correctly)","notes":"Fixed!

Store fingerprint alongside existing selectors\n\n### Re-anchoring Process\n\n1. **Primary**: Try text-based re-anchoring (TextQuoteSelector)\n2. **Secondary**: Try coordinate-based (PdfRegionSelector)\n3. **Fallback**: Visual fingerprint search:\n   - Scan nearby pages (current page + context)\n   - Generate fingerprints for candidate regions\n   - Find best match above confidence threshold\n\n### Fingerprint Types\n\n1. **pHash (Perceptual Hash)**: Robust to scaling, minor color changes\n2. **dHash (Difference Hash)**: Fast, good for exact matches\n3. **Combined**: Use both for confidence scoring\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Research perceptual hashing libraries (blurhash, blockhash-js, etc.)\n- [ ] Create `VisualFingerprint` type\n- [ ] Implement fingerprint generation from MuPDF pixmap\n- [ ] Add fingerprint storage to `PdfHighlightSelector`\n- [ ] Implement fingerprint comparison with confidence scoring\n- [ ] Create `VisualAnchor` class for re-anchoring\n- [ ] Integrate into `highlight-anchor.ts` as tertiary strategy\n- [ ] Add UI indicator for fingerprint-based matches (lower confidence)\n\n## Type Changes\n\n```typescript\ninterface PdfHighlightSelector {\n  format: 'pdf';\n  primary: { type: 'PdfPageSelector'; ... };\n  fallback: { type: 'PdfTextQuoteSelector'; ... };\n  region?: { type: 'PdfRegionSelector'; ... };\n  rects?: PdfHighlightRect[];\n  // NEW\n  fingerprint?: {\n    type: 'VisualFingerprint';\n    pHash: string;      // Perceptual hash\n    dHash?: string;     // Difference hash\n    thumbnail?: string; // Base64 tiny thumbnail for debugging\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/library/types.ts` - Add fingerprint to selector\n- `src/highlights/pdf-highlight-service.ts` - Generate fingerprints\n- `src/reader/renderer/highlight-anchor.ts` - Add visual anchor strategy\n- NEW: `src/highlights/visual-fingerprint.ts` - Fingerprint generation/comparison\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Fingerprint generated when creating PDF highlights\n- [ ] Re-anchoring uses fingerprint as fallback\n- [ ] Confidence score reflects match quality\n- [ ] UI indicates when fingerprint match was used\n- [ ] Works for scanned PDFs without text\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- PDF Highlights Core (for integration)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T02:12:44.264217-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-26T02:12:44.264217-06:00"}

Compare accumulated tile extent with page dimensions\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Page size independent of tile grid\n- [ ] Tile extent matches page size exactly (no overflow)\n- [ ] No accumulated rounding errors in tile calculations\n- [ ] Mode transitions use page size, not tile extent\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nPage size is the source of truth, tile grid is calculated to cover exactly that size without overflow, and mode transitions reference page size directly.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster A (Unit/Rounding - PRIMARY):** H1, H4, H5, H6, H7\n- All reduce to INV-4 violations producing int vs float disagreement","notes":"## Analysis Update (2026-01-22)\n\n**Finding:** This issue is ORTHOGONAL to ScaleStateManager architecture.\n\nScaleStateManager ensures scale consistency across TIME (epoch-based validation).

Runtime Monitor Activation\n- [ ] Verify `RuntimeMonitor.start()` is called when PDF view opens\n- [ ] Confirm RAF loop is running (`_rafId` is set)\n- [ ] Check `onAlert()` callbacks are registered\n- [ ] Validate FPS thresholds: warning=45, critical=30 (lines 180-181)\n\n### 2. Jank Detection\n- [ ] Verify frame times \u003e16.67ms are counted as jank (line 383-386)\n- [ ] Confirm `jankCount` increments during choppy scroll\n- [ ] Check frame time variance is being tracked (lines 422-438)\n- [ ] Validate thermal throttling detection triggers on sustained high variance\n\n### 3. Speed Zone Detection\n- [ ] Verify `getSpeedZone()` is called during scroll\n- [ ] Confirm zone transitions: stationary→slow→medium→fast→veryFast\n- [ ] Validate quality factors are applied:\n  - stationary: 1.0\n  - slow: 0.9\n  - medium: 0.75\n  - fast: 0.5\n  - veryFast: 0.35\n\n### 4. Inertia Scroll Behavior\n- [ ] Verify inertia decay (0.92) produces smooth momentum\n- [ ] Confirm `INERTIA_START_THRESHOLD` (3 px/s) triggers fling\n- [ ] Validate `INERTIA_MIN_VELOCITY` (0.5 px/s) stops animation\n- [ ] Check tile updates during inertia use 16ms throttle\n\n### 5. Telemetry Capture\n- [ ] Verify `trackScrollFrame()` is called per scroll event\n- [ ] Confirm velocity is calculated correctly\n- [ ] Check jank events are aggregated in session telemetry\n- [ ] Validate FPS summary is included in telemetry export\n\n## Speed Zone Thresholds (Reference)\n\n```\nZone       | Speed (px/s) | Lookahead | Quality\n-----------|--------------|-----------|--------\nstationary | 0-50         | 1.0x      | 1.0\nslow       | 50-200       | 2.0x      | 0.9\nmedium     | 200-500      | 3.0x      | 0.75\nfast       | 500-1000     | 5.0x      | 0.5\nveryFast   | \u003e1000        | 8.0x      | 0.35\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `RuntimeMonitor` is running and producing FPS metrics\n- [ ] Jank events (\u003e16.67ms frames) are being counted\n- [ ] Speed zones correctly classify scroll velocity\n- [ ] Quality reduction is applied during fast scroll (visible in telemetry)\n- [ ] Inertia scroll feels smooth with trackpad (subjective but critical)\n- [ ] FPS warnings/critical alerts fire when thresholds are exceeded\n\n## Testing Protocol\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Synthetic FPS tests do NOT capture real UX. Always test with actual trackpad gestures.\n\n1. Open PDF with `Amnesia: Open book` command\n2. Verify leaf type is `amnesia-reader` (not built-in `pdf`)\n3. Start RuntimeMonitor: `window.Amnesia.debug.getRuntimeMonitor().start()`\n4. Perform real trackpad scroll gestures at various speeds\n5. Check metrics: `window.Amnesia.debug.getRuntimeMonitor().getMetrics()`\n6. Check telemetry: `window.Amnesia.debug.getTelemetry().scroll`\n7. FEEL the responsiveness - numbers mean nothing if scroll feels janky\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- Safari has different gesture event handling (see `pdf-gesture-handler.ts:7bg`)\n- Memory pressure can cause FPS drops (check `MemoryMetrics.pressure`)\n- Long tasks (\u003e50ms) block main thread and cause jank\n- Device thermal throttling increases frame time variance","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"105689291+jjjjguevara@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:14:49.766246-06:00","created_by":"Josue Guevara","updated_at":"2026-01-26T01:14:49.766246-06:00"}

Mixing these APIs causes accumulated precision errors.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe codebase may use `getBoundingClientRect()` in some places (returning float values like 517.647) and `offsetHeight` in others (returning integer values like 518). This inconsistency causes the 0.353px delta observed in the logs.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- Multiple files across the PDF renderer\n- Search for `getBoundingClientRect` and `offsetHeight` usage patterns\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol E: Coordinate Conversion Error** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1. Audit all measurement API usage:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"getBoundingClientRect\\|offsetHeight\\|offsetWidth\\|clientHeight\\|clientWidth\" apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/\n```\n\n2.

EPUB currently has no device-tier awareness.\n\n## PDF Device Detection System\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Functions |\n|------|---------|---------------|\n| `src/reader/renderer/pdf/device-profiler.ts` | Electron-based detection | `generateDeviceProfile()`, `os.totalmem()`, `os.cpus()` |\n| `src/reader/renderer/pdf/system-profiler.ts` | Web-based fallback | `SystemProfiler.getProfile()`, `navigator.deviceMemory` |\n| `src/reader/renderer/pdf/performance-config.ts` | Tier-based settings | `getConfigForTier()`, tier definitions |\n| `src/reader/renderer/pdf/resource-detector.ts` | Unified facade | Coordinates profiler + recommendations |\n\n## EPUB Files to Modify\n\n| File | Current State | Modification Needed |\n|------|---------------|---------------------|\n| `mupdf-epub-content-provider.ts:74-81` | Fixed 5min/30min TTL | Scale cache TTL/size by tier |\n| `mupdf-epub-content-provider.ts:242-249` | Fire-and-forget prefetch | Scale prefetch count by tier |\n| `paginated-navigator.ts:56-65` | Fixed window size (3 chapters) | Scale by device memory |\n| `scrolled-navigator.ts:362-383` | Fixed virtual window | Scale by device memory |\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Integrate Device Detection\n1.

If the conversion to CSS pixels differs between:\n- Tiled path: `pageHeight * scaleTier / 72 * dpi`\n- Full-page path: `pageHeight * zoom / 72 * dpi`\n\n...the resulting dimensions may not match, especially if intermediate calculations use different rounding.\n\n### Code Locations\n\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/pdf-canvas-camera.ts` - Coordinate conversions\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/mupdf-worker.ts` - PDF rendering with unit conversion\n- `apps/amnesia/src/reader/renderer/pdf/tile-render-engine.ts` - Tile coordinate calculations\n\n### Debugging Protocol\n\nUse **Protocol E: Coordinate Conversion Error** from balancing-forces.md:\n\n1.

Compare conversion results between paths at same zoom level\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Single PDF units conversion function used throughout\n- [ ] Same page renders to identical dimensions regardless of path\n- [ ] Conversion is deterministic and reversible\n\n### Expected After Fix\n\nPDF units to CSS pixels conversion is centralized and consistent across all rendering paths.\n\n### Cluster\n\n**Cluster A (Unit/Rounding - PRIMARY):** H1, H4, H5, H6, H7\n- All reduce to INV-4 violations producing int vs float disagreement","notes":"## Analysis Update (2026-01-22)\n\n**Finding:** This issue is ORTHOGONAL to ScaleStateManager architecture.\n\nScaleStateManager ensures scale consistency across TIME (epoch-based validation).

This breaks offline use and adds latency for scanned PDF text extraction.\n\n## Goal\n\nImplement offline-capable hybrid OCR that:\n1. Uses client-side Tesseract.js WASM for offline/fast extraction\n2. Falls back to server-side OCR for better accuracy when available\n3. Integrates with content-type detection for automatic routing\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n**OCR Client** (`src/assets/ocr-client.ts`):\n```typescript\nexport interface OCRProvider {\n  readonly name: string;\n  isAvailable(): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e;\n  processImage(request: OCRRequest): Promise\u003cOCRResult\u003e;\n  processBatch?(requests: OCRRequest[]): Promise\u003cOCRResult[]\u003e;\n}\n```\n\nProviders: `TesseractProvider` (server), `OllamaProvider` (server), `MockOCRProvider` (test)\n\n## Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Tesseract.js Integration\n\n1. Add `tesseract.js` as optional dependency (lazy-loaded)\n2. Create `TesseractWasmProvider` implementing `OCRProvider`\n3. Bundle size strategy: Lazy load WASM + language data (~2-4MB)\n4. Cache language data in IndexedDB for repeat use\n\n### Phase 2: Hybrid Routing\n\n1. Create `HybridOCREngine` that coordinates providers\n2. Routing logic:\n   - Offline: Use Tesseract.js only\n   - Online + simple content: Use Tesseract.js (faster)\n   - Online + complex content: Use server (Ollama for better accuracy)\n3. Add quality detection to choose best result\n\n### Phase 3: Integration\n\n1. Wire into `TextExtractionCoordinator` from text layer issue\n2. Add settings for OCR provider preference\n3.

Retina-Quality Buffer at Max Zoom\n- Ensure buffer sizing accounts for device pixel ratio at all zoom levels\n- At \u003e16x zoom (full-page mode), buffer should still provide retina-quality pixels for visible region\n- Scale calculation: visible viewport × devicePixelRatio = minimum buffer resolution\n\n### 2. Focal-Point Radial Priority System\n- Tiles/pages near focal point: highest quality, highest cache priority\n- Middle-distance tiles: standard quality\n- Distant tiles/pages: thumbnails or lower quality acceptable\n- Priority radiates outward from focal point (zoom center or pan direction)\n\n### 3. Pan-Gesture Quality Preservation\n- During pan at high zoom: maintain quality for current view, don't downgrade\n- Pre-fetch adjacent tiles at current quality level\n- Only drop quality for tiles scrolling OUT of view, not IN\n\n### 4. Zoom Direction Awareness\n- Zoom in: Evict distant pages, prioritize focal point tiles at high quality\n- Zoom out: Transition to cached buffer, then generate thumbnails for newly visible pages\n- Keep last full-size pages cached until re-zoom gesture initiates\n\n### 5. Memory Management\n- Prevent Chromium tile_manager memory exhaustion at 32x zoom\n- Graceful quality degradation based on distance from focal point\n\n## Key Behaviors\n\n- Cache preserves last full-size pages until re-zoom gesture initiates\n- Focal-point radial priority ensures best quality where user is looking\n- Pan gestures maintain quality (no flicker/blur during simple panning)\n- Zoom-out shows previously cached high-quality buffer before thumbnails\n\n## Related Files\n\n- tile-cache-manager.ts\n- tile-render-engine.ts\n- render-coordinator.ts\n- progressive-tile-renderer.ts\n- pdf-infinite-canvas.ts (getTilePriority)","notes":"Phase 1 COMPLETE (2026-01-22): Focal-point-aware eviction fully implemented.\n\nImplemented:\n- TileCacheManager.setPriorityFunction() API\n- TileCacheManager.evictByPriority() implementation  \n- Memory pressure integration (3 levels)\n- Priority function wired in pdf-infinite-canvas using actual PageLayout positions\n- Cleanup: priority function cleared on canvas destroy\n- Fixed coordinate bug for multi-page priority\n\nRemaining Phases:\n- Phase 2: Retina-Quality Buffer (0%)\n- Phase 3: Pan-Gesture Quality Preservation (0%)\n- Phase 4: Zoom Direction Awareness (0%)\n- Phase 7-9: Quality falloff (0%)\n\nPhase 1 should provide enough memory relief to attempt H1 verification (amnesia-5hf).

{"id":"amnesia-xlc.3","title":"JPEG Tile Slicing for Tiled Mode - enable at high zoom","description":"## Objective\n\nEnable JPEG extraction for tiled mode (zoom \u003e 4x) by implementing proper tile slicing. The current implementation is disabled because extracting full-page JPEG for tile keys caused a \"checkerboard\" visual bug.\n\n## Background\n\nThe issue at `render-coordinator.ts:1996`:\n```typescript\nconst JPEG_EXTRACTION_ENABLED_FOR_TILES = false; // Set to true when tile slicing is added\n```\n\nThe problem: JPEG extraction returns the ENTIRE page, but the tile cache expects tile-sized pieces. When full-page JPEGs were cached under tile keys, they were drawn at each tile position causing checkerboard artifacts.\n\n## Solution Architecture\n\n### 1. Add Extracted JPEG Cache\nStore decoded full-page images for slicing:\n```typescript\n// In TileCacheManager or new class\nprivate extractedJpegCache: Map\u003cstring, {\n  imageData: ImageData,\n  width: number,\n  height: number,\n  pageNum: number,\n  lastAccess: number,\n}\u003e = new Map();\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Tile Slicing\n```typescript\nasync getJpegTile(\n  docId: string,\n  page: number, \n  tileX: number, \n  tileY: number, \n  tileSize: number, \n  scale: number\n): Promise\u003cImageData | null\u003e {\n  const cacheKey = `${docId}-${page}`;\n  let cached = this.extractedJpegCache.get(cacheKey);\n  \n  if (!cached) {\n    // Extract and decode JPEG to ImageData\n    const jpegData = await this.extractJpegCallback(docId, page);\n    const decoded = await this.decodeJpegToImageData(jpegData);\n    cached = { imageData: decoded, width: jpegData.width, height: jpegData.height, pageNum: page, lastAccess: Date.now() };\n    this.extractedJpegCache.set(cacheKey, cached);\n  }\n  \n  cached.lastAccess = Date.now();\n  \n  // Calculate tile bounds in source image\n  const srcX = tileX * tileSize * scale;\n  const srcY = tileY * tileSize * scale;\n  const srcW = Math.min(tileSize * scale, cached.width - srcX);\n  const srcH = Math.min(tileSize * scale, cached.height - srcY);\n  \n  // Slice tile from ImageData\n  return this.sliceTile(cached.imageData, srcX, srcY, srcW, srcH, tileSize);\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Memory Budget (Device-Aware)\nWire to existing device profiler:\n```typescript\nimport { getDeviceProfile } from \"./device-profiler\";\n\nfunction getJpegCacheLimit(): number {\n  const profile = getDeviceProfile();\n  const memoryGB = profile.memory.totalGB;\n  \n  // Budget: 1% of system RAM for JPEG cache\n  // - 8GB system → 80MB JPEG cache\n  // - 16GB system → 160MB JPEG cache\n  // - 32GB system → 320MB JPEG cache\n  return Math.max(50, Math.min(500, memoryGB * 10)) * 1024 * 1024;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Cache Lifecycle\n- **Eviction triggers**: Document close, memory pressure, LRU when over budget\n- **LRU eviction**: Remove least-recently-accessed pages first\n- **Viewport priority**: Never evict pages in current viewport\n\n### 5.
